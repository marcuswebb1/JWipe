<h1>JWipe - Disk Wiping Utility</h1>

In this lab we're going to walk through a demonstration of the JWipe - Disk Wiping Utility I programmed. Learning how to program this will definitely help sharpen your PowersShell skills, so I'd highly recommend following along, asking questions where things are unclear, and eventually try to build it on your own without watching. Please let me know if you have any questions!
